## Image plugin

- Implement a proper solution in dev mode
- Clean up the code, especially the separation between dev and build mode (should these be two separate plugins?)
- Write tests - this could mean exporting some stuff from e2e as helpers.
- Make it actually support file types since it's useful for dev

## Dev mode

- Currently bundles all code and runs using `Function`. Really should pre-build dependencies into separate .cache folder and then reroute imports to it.
  - Can then use some sort of load module or import with data url to actually import the bundled src code

## Errors

Support errors in plugins etc, so that I can have custom error types in the files package
