# hd-web

A set of open source packages to help you quickly create static websites with a splash of interactivity using the html, css and js you already know.

The main package is `hd-web` which should contain everything you need to build your site.

Or get up and running quickly with `@hd-web/create`

See examples in the examples folder to get some inspiration and check out `@hd-web/components` for reusable components you might find useful in your own project.
