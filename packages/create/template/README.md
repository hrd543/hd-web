You're all set for your first static site with hd-web!

Add any site information you need to index.html inside src. This'll be your site's main page.

Then, change the App function inside src/index.tsx to be your site's html, written using jsx. See the default example for a hello world option.

Finally, run the build command to build the js and then load the html file, located within the build folder, in your browser to see your site!

Or run the dev command to spin up a local server which will refresh on each change. Find it at localhost:8080
