You're all set for your first static site with hd-web!

Add any site information you need to index.html inside src. This'll be your site's main page.

Then, change the App function inside src/index.tsx to be your site's html, written using jsx. See the default example for a hello world option.

Finally, run the build command to build the js and then load the html file, located within the build folder, in your browser to see your site!
